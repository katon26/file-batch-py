# Batch editor for files 

## Description
This is a simple file manager that allows u to perform basic operations on files written in Python and uses the `os` module to interact with the file system.

I dont know the reason why I created this project, but I think it is a good way to practice my python skills... especially when i am bored and too lazy for create manualy a lot of files. so i'd try to create a program that can do that for me. 

run this command to start the program:
```python
python main.py
```

## Features
- batch creating new files and 
- Renaming files (not implemented yet)
- Deleting files
- idk
- still idk

Feel free to contribute to this 'i dont know what specific name to give' project.
